  BD +880:  ✅ Available (Bangladesh landline & mobile)
  Cost:     BD number ~$5-15/mo (varies), free SIP account included

  Step 1: Sign up at https://hottelecom.biz

  Step 2: Buy a Bangladesh number
          Virtual Numbers → Bangladesh → Select number type
          Choose: Landline (+880-2-XXXX for Dhaka) or Mobile
          Complete purchase (crypto payment available)

  Step 3: Get SIP Credentials
          After number is connected (usually within 24 hours):
          Go to: SIP/IAX section in your personal account
          Request SIP credentials if not auto-created
          Note down: SIP server, username, password

  Step 4: Configure Call Forwarding to SIP
          In your HotTelecom dashboard → Your number settings
          Set forwarding destination to SIP
          Enter SIP URI: sip:{{VPS_IP}}:{{SIP_PORT}}

          OR if they require registration-based forwarding:
          Forward to their SIP account, then configure their SIP
          to relay to your VPS IP

  Step 5: Verify the setup
          Call your +880 number from any phone
          Check SIP logs: sip-manage.sh logs follow

  ⚠️  HotTelecom numbers may take up to 24 hours to activate.
  ⚠️  If direct SIP URI forwarding isn't available, contact their
      support to set up SIP forwarding to your VPS IP.
  ⚠️  Bangladesh numbers may require identity documents (passport/ID).

  Alternative: If SIP forwarding to external IP doesn't work,
  you may need to configure LiveKit SIP to register as a SIP
  client to HotTelecom's server. Contact support for details.
