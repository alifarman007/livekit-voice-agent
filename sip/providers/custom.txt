  Provider: Custom / Any SIP Trunk Provider
  Website:  (your provider)
  BD +880:  Depends on provider

  Any SIP trunk provider works with LiveKit SIP if they support:
  ✅ Elastic or programmable SIP trunking
  ✅ Custom origination URI (forward calls to your server)
  ✅ UDP or TCP SIP transport

  Step 1: Buy a phone number from your provider

  Step 2: Create a SIP trunk in your provider's dashboard

  Step 3: Configure the trunk to forward calls to your VPS
          Origination URI: sip:{{VPS_IP}}:{{SIP_PORT}};transport=udp

          Some providers call this:
          - "Origination URI" (Twilio)
          - "SIP Connection" (Telnyx)
          - "Call Forwarding to SIP" (HotTelecom, Freezvon)
          - "Inbound Route" (generic)
          - "Trunk Destination" (generic)

  Step 4: Associate your phone number with the trunk
          The number must be linked to the trunk so incoming calls
          get forwarded to your VPS instead of a webhook

  Step 5: After provider setup, add the number to LiveKit:
          sip-manage.sh add-number +XXXXXXXXXXXX

  Step 6: Test by calling the number
          sip-manage.sh logs follow

  If your provider uses REGISTRATION mode instead of direct URI:
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Some providers (especially smaller ones) require your server to
  "register" to their SIP server rather than them pushing calls
  to your IP. In this case, you'll need to modify the LiveKit SIP
  config to include registration credentials. Refer to LiveKit
  SIP documentation: https://docs.livekit.io/sip/
